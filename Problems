Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- We use the sliding window technique with two pointers: left (l) and right (r).
- The right pointer moves forward one character at a time to expand the window.
- A set is used to keep track of characters currently in the window.
- If the character at the right pointer already exists in the set, it means we have a duplicate.
- To resolve this, we shrink the window from the left by removing characters from the set and moving the left pointer forward until the duplicate is removed.
- After adding the current character to the set, we update the maximum window size.
- This process continues until the right pointer has traversed the entire string.

Fibonacci
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).
