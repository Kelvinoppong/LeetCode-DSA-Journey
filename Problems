Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- We use the sliding window technique with two pointers: left (l) and right (r).
- The right pointer moves forward one character at a time to expand the window.
- A set is used to keep track of characters currently in the window.
- If the character at the right pointer already exists in the set, it means we have a duplicate.
- To resolve this, we shrink the window from the left by removing characters from the set and moving the left pointer forward until the duplicate is removed.
- After adding the current character to the set, we update the maximum window size.
- This process continues until the right pointer has traversed the entire string.
